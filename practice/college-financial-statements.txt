                                         Independent Auditors’ Report


The Board of Trustees
Pomona College:

Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Pomona College (the College), which comprise
the statements of financial position as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of activities
and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes to the financial statements.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation,
and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and
the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal
control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.

Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the College as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, and the changes in its net assets and its cash
flows for the years then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.




                                KPMG LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership,
                                the U.S. member firm of KPMG International Cooperative
                                (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity.
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated November 26,
2013, on our consideration of the College’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters.
The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting
and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over
financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance
with Government Auditing Standards in considering the College’s internal control over financial reporting
and compliance.

(1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
      (a)   Reporting Organization
            Founded in 1887, Pomona College (the College) is an independent, coeducational liberal arts college
            offering instruction in all major fields of the fine arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural
            sciences. The College has an enrollment of approximately 1,590 students and a student-faculty ratio
            of eight to one.

            Pomona College is a member of an affiliated group of colleges known as The Claremont Colleges.
            Each affiliated college is a separate corporate entity governed by a separate board of trustees. The
            Claremont University Consortium, a member of this group, acts as the coordinating institution,
            which provides common student and administrative services including certain central facilities
            utilized by all the colleges. The costs of these services and facilities are shared by the members of the
            group.

      (b)   Basis of Presentation
            The accompanying financial statements of the College are prepared on the accrual basis of
            accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

      (c)   Classification of Net Assets
            The accompanying financial statements present information regarding the College’s financial
            position and activities according to the following three net asset categories:

            Unrestricted Net Assets
            Unrestricted net assets represent expendable funds available for operations, which are not otherwise
            limited by donor restrictions.

            Temporarily Restricted Net Assets
            Temporarily restricted net assets consist of contributed funds subject to specific donor-imposed
            restrictions, contingent upon specific performance of a future event or a specific passage of time
            before the College may spend the funds, and earnings on endowment funds that have not yet been
            appropriated.

            Permanently Restricted Net Assets
            Permanently restricted net assets are subject to donor restrictions requiring that the assets be
            maintained in perpetuity. The investment income generated from these assets is temporarily
            restricted by law until appropriated by the board of trustees in support of the College’s programs and
            operations.

      (d)   Cash and Cash Equivalents
            Cash includes all short term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
            less when purchased. Cash and cash equivalents representing assets held in the investment pool are
            included in long-term investments (see note 6).

                                                        7                                                (Continued)

                                    Notes to Financial Statements
                                       June 30, 2013 and 2012



      The College maintains cash in various financial institutions, which periodically exceeds federally
      insured limits.

(e)   Investments
      Investments are reflected at fair value. The College uses net asset value (NAV) as a practical
      expedient for determining fair value of its financial instruments, in cases where appropriate criteria
      are met.

(f)   Management of Pooled Investments
      The College follows an investment policy which anticipates a greater long-term return through
      investing for capital appreciation and accepts lower current yields from dividends and interest. In
      order to offset the effect of lower current yields, the board of trustees has adopted a spending policy
      for pooled investments whereby annually, if the ordinary income from the pooled investments is
      insufficient to provide the full amount of investment return specified by the adopted spending policy,
      the balance may be appropriated from cumulative realized gains of the pooled investments.

(g)   Fair Value of Financial Instruments
      The College did not elect fair value accounting for any asset of liability that is not currently required
      to be measured at fair value.

      Fair value of the College’s financial instruments is determined using the estimates, methods, and
      assumptions as set forth below. See note 6 for further information regarding investments and their
      fair value.

      (i)    Cash equivalents, Accounts and Other Receivables, Accounts Payable, Accrued Payroll, and
             Other Liabilities

             Fair value approximates book value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

             A reasonable estimate of the fair value of student loans extended under government loan
             programs has not been made as the loans can only be assigned to the U.S. government.

      (ii)   CEFA Bonds Payable

             Fair value of bonds is estimated with Level 2 inputs, based on the discounted value of
             contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for
             similar maturities and credit quality. See note 8 for further information regarding CEFA bonds
             payable and their fair value.

      (iii) Life Income and Annuities Obligation

             The carrying amount of annuity and trust obligations approximates fair value as the
             instruments are recorded at the estimated net present value of future cash flows. The estimated
             fair value, however, involves unobservable inputs considered to be Level 3 in the fair value
             hierarchy.

                                    Notes to Financial Statements
                                       June 30, 2013 and 2012



(h)   Property, Plant, and Equipment
      Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost, representing the purchase price or fair market value
      at the date of gift, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed using the
      straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally, 7 years for equipment
      and land improvements and 40 years for buildings). Construction in progress will be depreciated
      over the useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for their intended use. The costs
      and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the related
      gains and losses are included in the statement of activities.

(i)   Art Collection
      The College does not record or capitalize its art collections. The fine art collections of the College
      are housed in the Pomona College Museum of Art. Among important holdings are the Kress
      Collection of 15th and 16th century Italian panel paintings; over 5,000 examples of Pre-Columbian
      to 20th century American Indian art and artifacts; and a large collection of American and European
      prints, drawings, and photographs. All works in the collection are catalogued, preserved, cared for,
      and monitored according to professional museum standards, and are subject to a policy that requires
      proceeds from deaccession to be used exclusively for acquisition of art works.

(j)   Life Income and Annuities Obligation
      The actuarial liability for life income and annuity contracts and agreements are based on the present
      value of future payments, discounted at a rate that is commensurate with the risks involved ranging
      from 2.00% to 7.25% and over estimated lives according to the Annuity 2000 Mortality Table.

(k)   Revenue and Expense Recognition
      Student tuition and fees are recorded as revenues in the year during which the related academic
      services are rendered. Student tuition and fees received in advance of services to be rendered are
      recorded as deferred revenues and are included in accrued payroll and other liabilities on the
      statement of financial position. Revenues from federal grants and contracts are recorded as allowable
      expenditures under such agreements are incurred. Contributions, including unconditional promises to
      give, are recognized as revenue in the period received and are reported as increases in the appropriate
      class of net assets. Conditional promises to give are not recognized until they become unconditional,
      that is, when the conditions on which they depend are substantially met. Contributions of assets other
      than cash are recorded at their estimated fair value. Contributions to be received after one year are
      discounted at an appropriate discount rate. An allowance for uncollectible contributions is estimated
      based upon such factors as prior collection history, type of contribution, and nature of fund-raising
      activity. Expenses are reported as decreases in unrestricted net assets. Gains and losses on
      investments, investment income, and other revenues are reported as increases or decreases in
      unrestricted net assets, unless their use is restricted by explicit donor stipulation.

(l)   Allocation of Certain Expenses
      The statement of activities presents expenses by functional classification. Depreciation expense,
      operation and maintenance of plant, and interest expense are allocated based on square footage


                                                  9                                              (Continued)

      occupancy of college facilities. Included in institutional support expense for the years ended June 30,
      2013 and 2012 are $7,277,000 and $7,344,000, respectively, of expenses related to fund-raising.

(m)   Expiration of Donor-Imposed Restrictions
      The expiration of a donor-imposed restriction on a contribution is recognized in the period in which
      the restriction expires. At that time, the related resources are reclassified to unrestricted net assets. A
      restriction expires when the stipulated time has elapsed, when the stipulated purpose for which the
      resource was restricted, has been fulfilled, or both.

      The College follows the policy of reporting as unrestricted support donor-imposed restricted
      contributions whose restrictions are met in the same period as received. It is the College’s policy to
      lift the restrictions on contributions of cash or other assets received for the acquisition of long-lived
      assets when the long-lived assets are placed into service.

(n)   Estates and Trusts
      The College is named beneficiary of various estates in probate. Unless the ultimate amount available
      for distribution can be determined before the close of the probate proceedings, the College does not
      record these amounts until the time of asset distribution. Trusts in which the College is named as
      irrevocable beneficiary, but is not a trustee, are recorded when the College is notified by the trustee
      and the ownership percentage and valuation are determined.

(o)   Estimates
      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to
      make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
      disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Estimates also
      affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, and other changes in net assets during the
      reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(p)   Income Taxes
      The College is exempt for federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code
      and Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code and is generally not subject to
      federal and state income taxes. However, the College is subject to income taxes on any income that
      is derived from a trade or business regularly carried on, and not in furtherance of the purposes for
      which it was granted exemption. No income tax provision has been recorded as the net income, if
      any, from any unrelated trade or business, in the opinion of management, is not material to the basic
      financial statements taken as a whole.

      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP prescribes for all entities,
      including pass-through entities, minimum thresholds for financial statement recognition of an
      uncertain position taken in filing tax returns (including whether an entity is taxable in a particular
      jurisdiction) and requires certain expanded tax disclosures. No such uncertain tax positions exist for
      the College at June 30, 2013 and 2012. The College files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal and
      the State of California jurisdictions, and is no longer subject to federal and state income tax
      examinations for tax years before 2008 and 2007, respectively.

(4)   Notes Receivable
      Notes receivable at June 30, 2013 and 2012, in thousands of dollars, are as follows:
                                                                                    2013                  2012

      Determination of the fair value of student loans receivable, which are primarily federally sponsored student
      loans with U.S. government mandated interest rates and repayment terms subject to significant restrictions
      as to their transfer and disposition, could not be made without incurring excessive costs.

(5)   Contributions Receivable
      Unconditional promises to give are included in the financial statements as contributions receivable and
      revenue of the appropriate net asset category. Promises to give are recorded after discounting, at rates
      ranging from 2.00% to 3.05% to the present value of the future cash flows. Unconditional promises to give
      received during the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 have been discounted at credit-adjusted rates
      commensurate with the risks associated with the contribution in accordance with Accounting Standards
      Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. These inputs to the fair value
      estimate are considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Book value approximates fair value.

      The College has been named remainderman in certain split-interest agreements. These trust agreements
      require that the trustee make annual or more frequent payments to the beneficiaries. Upon the death of the
      beneficiaries or other termination of the trusts, the remaining trust assets will be distributed to the College
      and other remaindermen as stipulated in the trust agreements. The College has recorded its beneficial
      interest in these split-interest agreements based on the present value of future cash flows using discount
      rates ranging from 4.55% to 7.25%. The actuarial assumption used in this calculation is based on the
      expected return on assets in effect at the date of the valuation. The underlying trust assets are valued at fair
      value and consist primarily of securities that are traded on the active market.

(6)   Investments
      (a)   Fair Value Measurement
            The fair value of the College’s financial instruments as of June 30, 2013 and 2012 represents
            management’s best estimates of the amounts that would be received to sell those assets in an orderly
            transaction between market participants at that date. Those fair value measurements maximize the
            use of observable inputs. However, in situations where there are little, if any, observable inputs,
            management’s own judgments about the assumptions of market participants were used in pricing the
            asset. Those judgments are developed by management based on the best information available in the
            circumstances.

            Although the College uses its best judgment in determining the fair value of investments, there are
            inherent limitations in any methodology. Therefore, the values presented herein are not necessarily
            indicative of the amount that the College could realize in a current transaction. Future confirming
            events could affect the estimates of fair value and could be material to the financial statements.
            These events could also affect the amount realized upon liquidation of the investments.

(b)   Absolute Return Strategies
      Investments utilizing an absolute return strategy are less liquid than the College’s other investments.
      These investments typically include certain types of financial instruments, including, among others,
      futures and forward contracts, options, and securities sold not yet purchased, intended to hedge
      against changes in the market value of investments. These financial instruments may result in loss
      due to changes in the market (market risk). The following table summarizes these investments by
      investment strategy type at June 30, 2013 and 2012, in thousands of dollars.
                                                                            2013

(d)   Pooled Fund
      Where permitted by gift agreements and/or applicable government regulations, investments are
      pooled. Pooled investments and allocations of pooled investment income are accounted for on a unit
      fair value method. The following table summarizes data pertaining to this method for the years ended
      June 30, 2013 and 2012:
                                                                            2013                2012

(e)   Fair Value Hierarchy
      The College’s fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
      value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
      identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
      (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

      Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date of
      identical, unrestricted assets. Assets and liabilities classified as Level 1 generally include listed
      equities, futures, options, and certain fixed-income securities.

      Level 2 – Quoted prices for markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all
      significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. Assets and liabilities classified as
      Level 2 generally include equity swaps, forward contracts, certain fixed-income securities,
      over-the-counter option contracts, and certain other derivatives.

                                                   16                                           (Continued)

                                 June 30, 2013 and 2012



Level 3 – Pricing inputs are unobservable for the asset and reflect management’s own assumptions to
determine fair value. Assets classified as Level 3 include private investments that are supported by
little or no market activity.

Inputs are used in applying the valuation techniques and broadly refer to the assumptions that the
College uses to make valuation decisions, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may include
quoted market prices, recent transactions, manager statements, periodicals, newspapers, provisions
within agreements with investment managers, and other factors. An investment’s level within the fair
value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. The categorization of an investment within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing
transparency of the investment and does not necessarily correspond to the College’s perceived risk of
that investment.

The investments in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, certain domestic and
international equities, certain emerging markets, certain real assets and certain domestic fixed
income are valued based on quoted market prices, and are, therefore, classified within Level 1.

The investments in certain international equities, certain emerging markets, domestic fixed income,
international fixed income, and certain real properties are valued based on quoted market prices of
comparable assets, and are, therefore, classified within Level 2.

The investments in private equity, long/short hedge funds, venture capital, absolute return hedge
funds, certain real assets, certain investment funds focused on domestic and international equities,
and international fixed incomes are valued utilizing unobservable inputs, and are, therefore,
classified within Level 3. These investments are presented in the accompanying financial statements
at fair value. The College’s determination of fair value is based upon the best available information
provided by the investment manager and may incorporate management assumptions and best
estimates after considering a variety of internal and external factors. Such value generally represents
the College’s proportionate share of the partner’s capital of the investment partnerships as reported
by their general partners. For these investments, the College has determined, through its monitoring
activities, to rely on the fair market value as determined by the investment managers.

The general partners of the underlying investment partnerships generally value their investments at
fair value. Investments with no readily available market are generally valued according to the
mark-to-market method, which attempts to apply a fair value standard by referring to meaningful
third-party transactions, comparable public market valuations, and/or the income approach.
Consideration is also given to financial condition and operating results of the investment, the amount
that the investment partnerships can reasonably expect to realize upon the sale of the securities, and
any other factors deemed relevant. An investment can be carried at acquisition price (cost) if little
has changed since the initial investment of the company and is most representative of fair value.
Investments with a readily available market (listed on a securities exchange or traded in the
over-the-counter market) are valued at quoted market prices or at an appropriate discount from such
price if marketability of the securities is restricted.

      general items.

      In July 2011, the College completed a new municipal bond financing through the CEFA 2011A
      Series bonds in the par amount of $7,310,000. Proceeds from the bonds were used in the defeasance of the
      CEFA 2001 Series bonds in the amount of $7,700,000.

      At June 30, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of the College’s CEFA bonds payable was approximately
      $201,388,000 and $213,418,000, respectively. Fair value was estimated based upon dealer quotes for
      similar instruments.

(11) Retirement Plans
     The College participates with other members of The Claremont Colleges in two retirement plans
     administered by the Claremont University Consortium – a defined-contribution plan and a defined-benefit
     plan. These plans cover all of the College’s eligible employees.

     The defined-contribution plan provides retirement benefits for all employees through Teachers Insurance
     and Annuity Association and the College Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF). Under this plan,
     College contributions are used to purchase fixed and/or variable annuities offered by TIAA-CREF. Vesting
     provisions are full and immediate. Benefits commence upon retirement and preretirement survivor death
     benefits are provided. In conjunction with this plan, employees are able to contribute a portion of their
     salary into a tax-deferred annuity account and invest such assets in mutual funds offered by TIAA-CREF,
     Fidelity Investments Institutional Services Company, Inc., or The Vanguard Group.

     Prior to July 1, 2005, certain retirement eligible employees participated in a defined-benefit plan, wherein
     the benefits were based on years of service, compensation, and the amount of employee contributions, if
     any. On June 30, 2005, the plan was frozen and all participants were immediately eligible to become

    participants in the defined-contribution plan. The defined-benefit plan continues to be funded in
    accordance with the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and for the years
    ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, the plan has met the minimum funding requirements. Plan assets are
    invested in a diversified group of equity and fixed-income securities, in an insurance company’s separate
    and general accounts. At June 30, 2013 and 2012, the College’s allocation of net pension costs was
    approximately $340,000 and $293,000, respectively. Also at June 30, 2013 and 2012, the College had a
    reserve for future funding payments of approximately $2,191,000 and $3,966,000 that was included in
    accrued payroll and other liabilities on the statement of financial position and approximately $2,923,000
    and $2,352,000, respectively, related to contributions made by employees to the College’s 457(b) Plan that
    were included in separately invested assets and accrued payroll and other liabilities on the statement of
    financial position.

    For the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, the College’s contributions to these plans amounted to
    approximately $5,980,000 and $5,828,000. Also included in the statement of activities for the years ended
    June 30, 2013 and 2012 is a comprehensive gain of $1,775,000 and a comprehensive loss of $1,382,000,
    respectively, relating to the staff retirement plan.

(12) Workers’ Compensation
    The College participates with other members of The Claremont Colleges in collective insurance
    agreements including self-insurance for workers’ compensation. At June 30, 2013 and 2012, the College
    had approximately $480,000 and $435,000, respectively, in accounts payable to provide for payment of
    claims pending. Management believes that the ultimate disposition of these or other claims would not
    result in any material adjustments to the financial statements.

(13) Endowment
    The net assets of the College include permanent endowment and funds functioning as endowment.
    Permanent endowments are subject to the restrictions of gift instruments requiring in perpetuity that the
    principal be invested and the income only be utilized as provided for under the California Uniform Prudent
    Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA). While funds functioning as endowment have been
    established by the board of trustees to function as endowment, any portion of such funds may be expended.

    The College’s endowment consists of approximately 1,800 individual funds established for a variety of
    purposes including both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the board of trustees to
    function as endowments. Net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the
    board of trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence
    of donor-imposed restrictions.

    (a)   Interpretation of Relevant Law
          The board of trustees of the College has interpreted the UPMIFA as permitting the preservation of
          the original gift as of the gift date of the donor-restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor
          stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpretation, the College classifies as permanently
          restricted net assets (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowments; (b) the
          original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment; and (c) accumulations to the


                                                     26                                              (Continued)

      permanent endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument
      at the time the accumulation is added to the fund.

      The remaining portion of the donor-restricted endowment fund that is not classified in permanently
      restricted net assets is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until those amounts are
      appropriated for expenditure by the College in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence
      prescribed by the Act. In accordance with the Act, the College considers the following factors in
      making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor-restricted endowment funds:

      1.    The duration and preservation of the fund

      2.    The purposes of the College and the donor-restricted endowment fund

      3.    General economic conditions

      4.    The possible effect of inflation and deflation

      5.    The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments

      6.    Other resources of the College

      7.    The investment policies of the College

(b)   Return Objective and Risk Parameters
      The College has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to
      provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to
      maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of
      donor-restricted funds that the College must hold in perpetuity as well as board-designated funds.
      Under this policy, as approved by the board of trustees, the endowment assets are invested in a
      manner that is intended to produce results that exceed the price and yield results of a custom
      benchmark that reflects the College’s current asset allocation targets and a simple benchmark
      composed of 85% of the S&P 500 Index and 15% of the Barclays Capital Government/Credit Bond
      Index, while assuming a moderate level of investment risk.

      The College expects its endowment funds to attain, over time and within acceptable risk levels, an
      average annual real rate of return of approximately 6.00%, net of all investment management and
      related fees and without regard to whether the return is in the form of income or capital gains. Actual
      returns in any given year may vary from this amount.

(c)   Strategies Employed for Achieving Objectives
      To satisfy its long-term rate-of-return objectives, the College relies on a total return strategy in which
      investment returns are achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and
      current yield (interest and dividends). The College targets a diversified asset allocation that places a
      greater emphasis on equity-based investments to achieve its long-term return objectives within
      prudent risk constraints.

                                         June 30, 2013 and 2012



(d)   Spending Policy and How the Investment Objectives Relate to Spending Policy
      The College has a policy of appropriating for distribution each year 4.50% to 5.50% of its
      endowment funds’ average fair value over the prior 12 quarters through June 30 one year prior to the
      beginning of the fiscal year in which the distribution is planned. In establishing this policy, the
      College considered the long-term expected return on its endowment. Accordingly, over the long
      term, the College expects the current spending policy to allow its endowment to maintain its
      purchasing power by growing at a rate at least equal to planned payouts. Additional real growth will
      be provided through new gifts and any excess investment return. In May 2010, the board of trustees
      approved a two-year deviation from the College’s endowment payout policy to permit the 12-quarter
      average spending rate to fall below 4.50% and to permit the growth in spending per unit to fall below
      4.00%. The temporary reduction in endowment payout was a response to the impact of the 2008
      financial crisis on the value of the endowment. For the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, the
      board of trustees authorized distributions of $68,638,000 and $65,022,000, respectively, based on an
      approved spending rate of 4.50% and 4.07%, for current operations from the realized investment
      gains of pooled investments.

      Endowment net assets consist of the following at June 30, 2013 and 2012, in thousands of dollars:

     (e)   Funds with Deficits
           From time to time, the fair value of assets associated with individual donor-restricted endowment
           funds may fall below the level that the donor or UPMIFA requires the College to retain as a fund of
           perpetual duration. Deficits of this nature that are reported in unrestricted net assets were $275,000
           and $1,881,000 as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These deficits resulted from unfavorable
           market fluctuations that occurred shortly after the investment of new permanently restricted
           contributions and continued appropriation for certain programs that was deemed prudent by the
           board of trustees. Subsequent gains that restore the fair value of the assets of the endowment fund to
           the required level will be classified as an increase in unrestricted net assets.

(14) Affiliated Institutions
     The amounts paid by the College to Claremont University Consortium for the common student and
     administrative services and the use of facilities for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 totaled
     $6,648,000 and $6,585,000, respectively.

(15) Commitments and Contingencies
     (a)   Line of Credit
           At June 30, 2013 and 2012, the College had a $50,000,000 line of credit, which expires on
           February 28, 2014. Any borrowings on the line would bear interest at a rate set by the bank (2.25%
           per annum at June 30, 2013 and 2012) and is subject to change from time to time. There were no
           borrowings outstanding on the line at June 30, 2013 and 2012.

     (b)   Federal Funding
           Certain federal grants that the College administers and for which it receives reimbursements are
           subject to audit and final acceptance by federal granting agencies. The amount of expenditures that
           may be disallowed by the grantor, if any, cannot be determined at this time. The College expects that
           such amounts, if any, would not have a significant impact on the financial position of the College.

(16) Subsequent Events
     On November 7, 2013, the College executed a $44,762,000 commitment with a Construction Company for
     the construction of a new laboratory and renovation of a Science Hall. The project is scheduled to be
     completed in the Fall of 2015. Subsequent events have been evaluated through November 26, 2013, which
     is the date the financial statements were issued. There are no additional subsequent events that require
     disclosure.
